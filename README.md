# 3D - Astronomy Project

This 3D Earth Model is an interactive visualization of our planet, created with NASA imagery. The model features a rotating globe that can be zoomed in and out and rotated in all directions. The model also has high resolution imagery of the Earth's landforms, oceans, and clouds. With this model, you can explore the beauty of our planet and its geography in a new and exciting way. But what makes it truly spectacular is the way the clouds move around it. The clouds swirl and wrap around the globe, creating a dynamic and mesmerizing effect. The clouds move quickly, like a living, breathing thing, and the globe appears to be alive with movement. The colors of the clouds and the shadows they cast on the continents are ever-changing and always captivating.
